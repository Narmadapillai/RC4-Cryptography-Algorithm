# RC4-Cryptography-Algorithm

AIM

Implement the RC4 algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text messages.


RC4 ALGORITHM

RC4 is a stream cipher and variable-length key algorithm. This algorithm encrypts one byte at a time (or larger units at a time). A key input is a pseudorandom bit generator that produces a stream 8-bit number that is unpredictable without knowledge of input key, The output of the generator is called key-stream, is combined one byte at a time with the plaintext stream cipher using X-OR operation. The different steps involved in this algorithm is stated and explained below. 
•	Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA):
RC4 operates on a variable-length key typically ranging from 40 to 2048 bits. The key is used to initialize two arrays: S (State) and a permutation array. S is initialized with values from 0 to 255 in ascending order, and the permutation array (K) is initialized with the key repeating as necessary to fill the array.
•	Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA):
During encryption or decryption, PRGA generates a stream of pseudo-random bytes based on the initialized arrays. The PRGA algorithm iterates over the elements of S, repeatedly swapping values and generating a pseudo-random byte at each iteration.

•	Encryption/Decryption:
To encrypt or decrypt data, RC4 XORs the plaintext with the pseudo-random byte stream generated by PRGA. This operation converts plaintext into ciphertext or ciphertext back into plaintext, depending on the direction of the operation and the key used for initialization.

•	Key Generation:
The key generation process involves both the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA). The output of the PRGA is used as the keystream, which is XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext, or XORed with the ciphertext to produce plaintext during decryption.

•	Security Considerations:
While RC4 was widely used, it has known vulnerabilities, particularly in its initial bytes, making it susceptible to biases and attacks such as the Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir (FMS) attack. Due to these vulnerabilities, RC4 is no longer recommended for use in secure systems, and alternatives like AES are preferred for encryption.
RC4's simplicity and speed made it popular, but its vulnerabilities led to its eventual deprecation. Understanding its operation provides insight into the principles of symmetric stream ciphers and the importance of robust cryptographic algorithms in securing sensitive data.


IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

1.	Implement the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) to initialize the permutation array based on the encryption key.

2.	Implement the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA) to generate a pseudo-random stream of bytes.


3.	Develop functions for encryption and decryption using the generated pseudo-random stream.

4.	Create functions to handle user input for plaintext and encryption key, and output the ciphertext and decrypted plaintext.


5.	Test the implementation with different plaintext messages and encryption keys to ensure correctness and security.

6.	Optionally, enhance the project by adding error handling and validation of user input.
